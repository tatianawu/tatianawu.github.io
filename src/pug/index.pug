                        Hi, I'm Tatiana!
                        I graduated from Stanford University with
                        a B.S. in Mathematical and Computational Science, an M.S. in Computer Science, and a minor in creative writing.
                        I’m particularly interested in machine learning and data science, and in the intersection of technology, social good, and ethics.
                        In my spare time, I enjoy fiction writing, playing piano, and teaching math and music theory.
                        Feel free to check out my LinkedIn or GitHub below, or use the navbar to learn more about me.
